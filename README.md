A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Build a simple application using Flutter compatible with Android/iOS devices.

- Build a simple aesthetic app to add/edit/delete/list movies that a user has watched.
- Show an infinite scrollable listview containing all the movies that a user has created.
- Implement a form to add a new movie or edit an existing one. (Fields to keep: Name, Director and a poster image of the movie)
- Each list item should have a delete icon to remove that movie from the list and an edit icon to allow edit on that movie.
- Store the data in any local database.

Brownie points for integrating persistent google authentication using firebase and then allowing only logged-in users to add movies.
